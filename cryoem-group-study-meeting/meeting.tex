\section{General Information}

Feel free to share this document and direct people to sign up at \url{https://forms.gle/BUeUW14vV4pyQbDDA} so I have the emails in one place. Online meeting links are emailed to those on this list. {\bf Please join the Slack group and ask questions there, rather than emailing me.}

\subsection{Audience and Streams}
Over 2/3 of the audience are grad students. There rest of the audience is a mix of long term staff (facility manager, seniour scientist, research associate, unspecified industry position, etc.), principal investigators (industry or academic), postdocs, and undergraduate. Meetings are labelled for the intended audience using the code names {\bf blur} and {\bf sharpen} , referring to map sharpening. Remember that both blurred and sharpened maps are important for being able to see what is going on and build a model in to the map. The goal of this study group is to have both intuition and be able to connect that back to the math, never missing the forest for the trees.

{\bf  Blur stream}: Beginners and intermediates with may have years of expertise doing sample prep, collecting data on the scope, making maps, and building models. However, many people with such expertise expressed a desire to go deeper into the fundamentals, and understand things better under the hood, and requested help to become more confident in the math. One person put it bluntly, "I am interested in being more than a button pusher."

{\bf Sharpen stream}: This stream can be for people with a high degree of expertise that are looking to sharpen their skills, and interact with other experts. For example: methods developers looking to make friends with each other, university instructors, facility managers who have a strong working knowledge but want to go deeper into the foundations and refresh, people with strong math and physics backgrounds that are fairly new but will catch on quickly, experts in crystallography that are switching over to cryoEM but that have a strong theoretical basis in the underlying math already.

\subsection{Pre-requisites}
This is a sort of lower bound, so that you don't show up and become lost or frustrated, especially in the blur stream. Not all of this background is needed. To learn about trilinear interpolation, you don't need to know anything about electron optics.

\subsubsection{Math}
You should be able to hit the ground running if you did alright in first year undergraduate calculus or did a second and third year statistics/physics/chemistry course with a quantitative and computational emphasis. If it's been a while you may want to quickly run through some online videos (khan academy for example) and brush up. You don't have to be strong in pure math (real analysis, proofs)
\begin{enumerate}
	\item calculus (single and multiple integrals, derivatives)
	\item trigonometry (sin, cos, etc.)
	\item linear algebra, 2D and 3D cartesian geometry, vectors, matrices
	\item statistics and probability (expectation, mean/variance, random variables, common distributions like gaussian/uniform/poisson)
	\item summation notation (sigma sums)
\end{enumerate}

Here are some resources from \url{khanacademy.org} for brushing up on your math

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus/dc-diff-intro}{Unit: Derivatives: definition and basic rules} 
	\item \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus/dc-chain}{Unit: Derivatives: chain rule and other advanced topics}
	\item \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus/ic-integration} {Unit: Integrals}
	\item \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus/ic-series}{Unit: Series}
	\item \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra}{Linear Algebra}
	\item \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library}{Unit: Probability}
	\item \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/counting-permutations-and-combinations}{Unit: Counting, permutations, and combinations}
	\item \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library}{Unit: Random variables}
\end{enumerate}

There is also a great series from \href{https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown}{3Blue1Brown} on \href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab}{The Essence of Linear Algebra}, focusing on visual intuition of  linear transformations; and the \href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr}{Essence of calculus}: "The goal here is to make calculus feel like something that you yourself could have discovered."

\subsubsection{Physics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Some exposure to modern (20th century) physics in a first or second year undergraduate course (relativity, QM). This comes in especially for the forward model.
	\item Some intuition about what is physically happening in the sample, at room temperature, after vitrification, and during imaging. The 2017 Chemistry Nobel lectures by Henderson, Dubochet and Frank would be more than enough.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Meeting Format}
The meetings are meant to be more informal that is typical in research talks. The point is to learn and discuss with other learners, experienced practitioners, and experts.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lecture with Q\&A
	\item Flipped classroom: i.e. we have a syllabus with pre-reading (textbook chapter, review paper) that we go through before and then discuss online
	\item Office hours with someone available to answer questions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Slack}
We will use the Slack channel 'cryoem\_study\_group' for asynchronous chat. Please join the Slack group and ask questions there, rather than emailing me. You can request a link to join by emailing me.

\subsection{Testimonials}

\begin{itemize}
	\item I believe that if I take 3 steps, it will bring me to a whole different level in cryo-EM: first, I would like to commit myself to sit down and derivate several key equations related to cryo-EM, thereby getting in-depth grasp of theory behind. Second, to play with simple programs (e.g. python scripts) written based on the equations. In doing so, I can gain a great sense of how the theory works practically. Finally, I want to spend a time for playing around the scope, which was not possible until now because we did not have cryo-EM. {\it Prof. Yuichiro Takagi}

	\item I am a PhD student with a biochemistry background, and have been working with NMR for the past 7 years before finally deciding to join a cryo-EM lab for post-doc. I have had zero cryo-EM experience before joining the study group. Since I started attending the meetings, I learned a ton of cryo-EM theory both from the readings and from talking to experts. Learning the theory has given me more confidence to go into my post-doc in a few months while switching fields. I really enjoy the spirit of discussion in the group. Going through some of the mathematical portion of the textbook [Single-particle Cryo-EM of Biological Macromolecules] has been especially helpful to me with understanding/imagining what is happening in the microscope, making it less like a 'black box'.
\end{itemize}

\section{Learning Resources}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item A good place to start is Grant Jensen's \href{https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/grant-jensen-cryo-em}{popular} online course \href{https://jensenlab.caltech.edu/courses/}{'Getting Started in Cryo-EM' }.

	\item After getting up to speed on the prerequisites, another good next step is the content developed by Dr Frederick Sigworth and others at \url{https://cryoemprinciples.yale.edu/video-lectures}. If you are having problems with links, then try viewing his content on YouTube.

	\item  Also, I highly recommend the interactive learning material developed by \href{http://cryoem.tudelft.nl/group/arjen-jakobi/}{Arjen Jakobi}, for a course on \href{https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/aj-lab/teaching/-/wikis/NB4020}{High-Resolution Imaging at TUDelft}: "The practicals are computational assignments in the form of interactive Jupyter notebooks hosted in a virtual learning environment. These notebooks contain code that can be executed to perform certain tasks or visualize results; you do not need any active knowledge of coding to work through the notebook." For the curious, the code that generates the visualizations is available on the repository.
 
	\item I have made an annotated bibliography organized thematically \href{https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math#resources}{here}.

	\item Coding notebooks to play around with are \href{https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/tree/master/nb}{here}. If there is incompatibility between the notebook and the \href{https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/tree/master/src}{code base} in the repo, that is because the code base has been updated. Older version of the code are available via past commits.

\subsection{19 Nov 2020 - Background Math \& Defocus Phase Contrast}
\subsubsection{Blur}
\textendash {Pre-reading}
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://youtu.be/CZkPG95eoS0}{Complex numbers and the complex exponential} (10 min)
\item \href{https://cryoemprinciples.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/1%20Review%20of%20Complex%20Numbers.pdf}{Review	of complex	numbers} (3 pages)
\item \href{https://youtu.be/m2Hm1ziZFZg}{Defocus phase contrast} (35 min)

\end{itemize}
\textendash {Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is physically happening to the sample when the electron is detected at small diffraction angles vs large diffraction angles? What else can happen to the electron?
%Watch video 2.1 (10 min). Towards the end (7:40 mark) Dr. Sigworth makes some interesting 2D/3D plots showing the real and imaginary part of exp(i theta). Code up a way to plot this and share it with everyone. For example, you could publish a coding notebook on something like GitHub.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sharpen}
\textendash{Pre-reading}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://youtu.be/m2Hm1ziZFZg}{Defocus phase contrast} (35 min)
	\item 6.2 The Wave Equation for Fast Electrons in 'Advanced Computing in Electron Microscopy', Kirkland (2020), pp. 156-159.
\end{itemize}
\textendash {Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item In Sigworth's derivation of $|\Psi|^2$ in the 'Defocus phase contrast' video, he made various assumptions such as small theta, small epsilon. Under what extreme conditions would they break down. Do these occur in cryoEM? In other experimental regimes besides what is typical in cryoEM?
\item Around the 23-25 min mark of the 'Defocus phase contrast' video the CTF seems to oscillate to zeros. Is this observed in practice? Why or why not?
\item Work through the derivation with pencil and eraser, justifying each step as best you can. come with your questions to the group study.
\item Biological samples are made of atoms that give faint contrast, when compared to samples with higher atomic numbers. Where does the atomic number of the sample come into the equations presented here?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sample a simple function (e.g. $\exp$, $\sin$, gaussian) in 1D or 2D. Then use some library to compute the FFT. Then compute the DFT in your own implementation. How close is the error? Work our the solution analytically for the continuous case. What should the answer be at some discrete points according to the continuous case, and how is it different from what the FFT gave? What is the typical floating point error? What was the speedup of the FFT, and how does this compare to the theoretical limit?
	\item In practice, how long are FFTs taking (2D and 3D)? How does this compare with other computational bottlenecks like disk I/O and interpolation?

	\item Solve the "homework problem" (without peeking at the answer!) in the first part of \href{https://youtu.be/_F-YDwY9X30}{Fourier transform: convolution, sampling and Nyquist}. If $g(x) = e^{-\pi(x-2)^2} - e^{-\pi(x+2)^2}$, what is $G(u)$?
	\item By the Convolution theorem $f(x)=g(x)*h(x) \Rightarrow F(u)=G(u)H(u)$. Since $F(u)=G(u)H(u)=H(u)G(u)$ we should have $f(x)=g(x)*h(x)=h(x)*g(x)$. Show explicitly the commutativity of the convolution operator: i.e., $g(x)*h(x)=\int dt \ g(t)h(x-t)=\int dt \ h(t)g(x-t)=h(x)*g(x)$
	\item Look at the animation in the notebook "ip\_basics\_part6". Write down the mathematical object that is being visualized, including integration bounds. What does one snapshot of the animation represent?
	\item When does convolution (physically or computationally) happen in cryoEM happen? Be specific when connecting things back to the math, e.g. what is being convolved, what is it's functional form, and how many dimensions are involved?
	\item When we convolve with a {\it broad/wide} gaussian function, what is happening in Fourier space? How does this relate to Fourier filtering? Hint, use the convolution theorem.

\end{itemize}
\textendash {Questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Around the 16 min mark in \href{https://youtu.be/_F-YDwY9X30}{Fourier transform: convolution, sampling and Nyquist}, we see that the de-convoluted (recovered) signal blows up around the origin, where there is a delta function. From the math, why exactly did this happen? Is there a way to over come this blowing up effect?
	\item Let $f_a=e^{-ax^2} \ ; \ a>0$. Show that $f_1*(f_2*f_3) = (f_1*f_2)*f_3$. Note that $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} dx \ e^{-ax^2} = \sqrt{\pi/a}$
	\item The notebook "ip\_basics\_part6" has an interactive where the size of the kernel (Sobel, Gaussian, etc) can be changed. Convoluting with larger kernels could be a more expensive computation, but we could speed it up by doing this in Fourier space by the convolution theorem. If we take the FT of the image and kernel, there sizes to not match, so how can we multiply them element wise? How would you match the pixel sizes and do things in Fourier space to achieve the same result as the real space convolution?
	\item In the last part of "ip\_basics\_part6", the Fourier filtering versus the convolution filtering appear the same for Guassian blur, but different for box blur, and very different for sharpen. What might be causing this? Vary the kernel size and notice the different run times. Is doing things in Fourier space always quicker? 
	\item How can we increase the Nyquist frequency during data collection to get higher resolution information? What is the trade off? What should guide our choice of an optimal Nyquist, given our particular microscope and specimen?
	\item Code up a simple example illustrating the convolution theorem, where you also actually do the convolution in real space. How close is it to the answer where you did the multiplication in Fourier space? What was the speedup? Now try speeding up the calculation by of the convolution in real space by making the convolution kernel smaller. How good of an approximation is this? Use a 2D projection of a 3D density map and a meaningful kernel (e.g. low pass filter) to build your intuition in a useful way.

\end{itemize}
\textendash {Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item See panel (b) in the \href{https://static5.olympus-lifescience.com/data/olympusmicro/primer/images/mtf/modulationfigure6.jpg?rev=480E}{'signal star'} image. What would this image look like if the CTF was applied (i.e. through convolution)?
	\item As defined in equation 11 of \href{https://cryoemprinciples.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/2%20Phase%20contrast.pdf}{'Phase-contrast imaging in the EM'}, what happens when the B factor is negative versus positive?
	\item In practice, on the scope, the CTF is easier to see in an FFT if you are at high mag. Why? Can you relate this back to the math? How is magnification playing into the equation?
	\item Can you tell the difference between underfocus and overfocus by eye? Try putting what you see into words? Why do they look different?
	\item As defined in equation 11 in \href{https://cryoemprinciples.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/2%20Phase%20contrast.pdf}{'Phase-contrast imaging in the EM'}, what physical behaviour is involved in this B factor? What other factors of B are there in cryoEM and what physical behaviour is involved in those B factors? Why are they all called B-factors?
	\item With reference to equation 11 in \href{https://cryoemprinciples.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/2%20Phase%20contrast.pdf}{'Phase-contrast imaging in the EM'}: "B has units of nm$^2$ or $ \AA^2$ and is called the 'B-factor' or 'envelope factor'. Good cryo-EM images have B values of $50-100 \AA^2$, but even these values are not so ideal. At $B = 100  \AA^ 2$ spatial frequencies of $5 \AA^2$ are attenuated to 1/e of their original amplitude, and higher spatial frequencies are attenuated even more". Go to 'ip\_basics\_part7' and play with B. Is there agreement between the B factor explanation and the interactive notebook? Take a closer look at how the interactive notebook \href{https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/aj-lab/teaching/-/blob/master/binder/hri_practical01/shared/misc.py#L757}{codes up the B factor} and what pixel size is used/assumed.
	\item Play with the amplitude contrast. Do you 'want' more or less amplitude contrast? If the amplitude contrast is off, how will this effect CTF fitting? Can you think of a good reason why many CTF estimators do not fit amplitude contrast? If you are unsure as to the amplitude contrast, what should you do?
	\item Play around with 'plot\_ctf\_img\_interactive' in Question 4 of 'ip\_basics\_part7'. Turn on 'ctf\_multiply'. Can you see how the information is delocalized more when the defocus increases? How defocused can the image get? Where does the information delocalize to? When collecting data on a real micrograph (versus computationally applying the CTF to a synthetic image the size of a particle), what issues would you have?

Is this the case in Vulovi\'{c} et al.? If so, what sorts of models would break the pixel independence?
	\item For the sake of argument, let's say that our goal is to use more accurate forward models (multislice based, higher order series expansions phase and amplitude object), instead of projection. In practice, how would one go about doing 3D reconstruction with these more accurate forward models? What would be the computational bottlenecks in doing so?

Question: using pencil and paper, compute the rotation of the point $ r=\langle1,0,0\rangle$ about the z-axis by $\theta=180^{\circ}$ (ccw or cw, it's the same for this angle). Do you get $r=\langle-1,0,0\rangle$? You will have to use the quaternion multiplication table ($ij=k$, etc.), and know how to interconvert quaternions to cartesian 3D vectors.

If we want to rotate many xyz points in space with a 3D rotation, what is the efficient way to do this? Taking into account interconversions between different rotation conventions (Euler angles, rotation matrices, axis-angle, and quaternions) how should we efficiently store rotations versus do rotations?

What is the bottle neck for interpolation? You can try to read through the code, and also empirically benchmark things (e.g. sample a 2D or 3D Gaussian, which will give you real values, then compute the Gaussian function at these points, and interpolate on a cartesian grid at a specified granularity).
	\item Code up your own implementation of some sort of interpolation, that works in a similar way as \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.griddata.html}{scipy.interpolate.griddata}, ie data point coordinates, data values (at those coordinates), and points at which to interpolate data. What is the bottle neck? How would you speed it up? 
	\item Investigate how sensitive \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.griddata.html}{scipy.interpolate.griddata} is to noise, by sampling a function, corrupting it with noise, and seeing how smooth things have to be for the interpolation to work out well. Can you find a situation where there are pathologies?

\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-dynerman-6a4a47101/}{Dr. David Dynerman} is currently the Chief Scientific Officer at \href{https://www.thepublichealthco.com/}{The Public Health Company}. Prior to this he lectured on cryoEM at Berkeley, where he also worked with Eva Nogales (Molecular \& Cell Biology) and Bernd Sturmfels (Mathematics) to develop new algorithms for 2D $\rightarrow$ 3D reconstruction in cryo-electron microscopy. His lecture will explain direct Fourier inversion (2D $\rightarrow$ 3D reconstruction). \\ \\

\end{enumerate}
\textendash {Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Look through the "Log" from the command
	\begin{lstlisting}
cryodrgn train_vae data/128/particles.128.mrcs \
	--ctf data/ctf.pkl  \
	--poses data/poses.pkl  \
	--zdim 8  \
	-n 50  \
	--uninvert-data  \
	-o tutorial/00_vae128 > tutorial_00.log							
	\end{lstlisting}		
	Take a deep breath and go through it line by line calmly and patiently. What do you understand? What is confusing?	Using the Log output as a guide, can you draw a schematic picture of the architecture?
	\item The tutorial suggests 50 epochs for training. Can you learn anything from the other epochs? What would indicate that you should run more/less epochs?
	\item Consider the figure with the caption "kmeans20 volumes: vol\_000.mrc to vol\_019.mrc". What do these results tell you about the particles? What would be some next steps upon seeing these results?	
	\item Compare the location of the 20 density maps in PCA vs UMAP space. How are they the same and how are they different?
	\item The tutorial notes that "Principal component trajectories can also produce nonphysical "motions", e.g. if there is discrete variability in the structure." What evidence form cryoDRGN supports discrete vs continuous variability?	 What role can domain knowledge play here?
	\item The tutorial explains how to filter out junk. What other ways are there to filter out junk and how does cryoDRGN compare with these? When would you use one over another?
	\item Look at "rhe resulting 6 clusters" from the GMM. On the right panel, why are there particles scattered/delocalized? Carefully read how the GMM in the tutorial was done. It might help to look up UMAP (For the curious I would recommend this \href{https://youtu.be/nq6iPZVUxZU}{SciPy talk} by one of the original UMAP authors). Note that this is a sort of "trick question".	
	\item The tutorial reports that "in practice, we often find that junk particles are located as outliers in the distribution of latent encodings." Why do you think this happens? What rules of thumb should you use to decide how many junk particles you should set aside. What problems might this cause, and how could you check if these problems were occurring? 
	\item It's nice to have fast code, but day and week long experiments put things in perspective. What counts as "long" and "short" run times for data processing. How long are you willing to wait. Be honest, because this can help developers provide methods that people end up using in practice.
	\item Compare the density maps with junk at 128 pixels vs high resolution without junk at 256 pixels.
	\item Look at the high resolution "PC trajectories" (movies). In your own words, how would you describe this trajectory? What might the biological meaning of it be? Non-biological? What work would we have to do to untangle biological from non-biological conclusions?
	\item Look at the "plot of the learning curve (i.e. average loss per epoch)". What can we conclude from this graph? What else might it look like, and what should we do in that case?
	\item Let's say you are interested in determining to what extent conformations are discrete or continuous (e.g. an ion channel opening). Describe a workflow, including the generation of an initial reference (volume, pose, ctf), to investigate this. What steps would be involved, what would you look for at each step, and about how long would each step take.
	\item Look at how the reconstruction changes with the number of particles.  Use the lasso tool to select small and smaller subsets and compare by eye in a 3D viewer.
	\item "CryoDRGN's graph traversal algorithm builds a nearest neighbor graph between all the latent embeddings, and then performs dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path on the graph between the anchors nodes." What biological meaning might such a path have? What other features of a path would have biological (or should we say physical) meaning? How might we extend \href{https://youtu.be/GazC3A4OQTE}{Dijkstra's algorithm} to find other interesting paths?
	\item Let's assume that our sample was experiencing conformational heterogeneity in a defined way: with one degree of freedom, but with two Gaussian distributed clusters along this degree of freedom. For example a protein opening and closing, where there is a Gaussian distribution around the open and closed state, along the coordinate connecting the two. If we used cryoDRGN on such a dataset, what would our results look like? How would things change as the spread of the Gaussians increased so that they bled into each other?
	\item A cryoEM dataset is frozen in time, and represents a time average. Sometimes we are interested in inferring the temporal sequence of events, for instance consider the conformational states of \href{https://youtu.be/y-uuk4Pr2i8}{Kinesin}. But is a temporal sequence always obvious from different states? Imagine different scenarios that might be easier and harder to infer a temporal sequence from the type of data available in cryoEM, and the analysis offered by cryoDRGN.

\textendash {Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item In \href{https://youtu.be/nyk75ufbP74}{Part 2: 2-D Waves and Images}, Grant Jensen shows some visualizations of 2D waves. He enters values for h, k, amplitude, and phase, and a wave appears on the screen. Let's say we wanted to "spin a wave around" the origin. For instance make 360 waves that were each rotated by 1 degree. What values would we enter?
	\item If we took the Fourier transform of one of the 2D waves in \href{https://youtu.be/nyk75ufbP74}{Part 2: 2-D Waves and Images}, what would it look like? What happens as the wave is translated?
	\item Sometimes people see "water rings" in the power spectra during CTF estimation. How exactly does it arise, and why is it a ring? What makes it more or less bright? What controls the ring's width/spread?
	\item How would you make a checker-board-like pattern (e.g. 8x8) with Jensen's wave program?
	\item If we Fourier crop (hard low pass filter) a 3D map (256 pixels, $1 \AA$ / pixel) at $8 \AA$, how many "waves" go into the map?
	\item Around 15:20 in \href{https://youtu.be/fEyLh9HqsWU?t=920s}{Part 2: 2-D Transforms and Filters} Jensen remarks that the location of pixels in Fourier space is perpendicular to the location of the crest of the waves in real space. If we are on the scope and take a live FFT of a gridded pattern (pieces of a lattice, rotated in all sorts of directions), we see a ring. What happens to the ring in the FFT when we translate the stage in one direction.
	\item Play around a coding notebook on the discrete Fourier transform I made here: \url{https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/blob/98cce6f1142af0aea8647f7a488d899f7336792d/nb/dft_sandbox.ipynb}

	\item Nogales mentions several unique capabilities of cryo-EM 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item samples not amenable to other structural biology techniques (polymers and viruses, integral membrane proteins),
		\item samples where that have properties that makes them amenable to cryoEM (large assemblies)
		\item samples with a challenge that poses no problem to cryoEM: scarce samples
		\item areas where data processing can help: compositionally heterogeneous samples, conformationally complex samples
	\end{enumerate}
	 Discuss some interesting examples that touch on these areas (e.g. work out of your lab, interesting projects you've come across).
	\item Structural biology techniques (CryoEM, NMR, SAXS, X-ray crystallography, etc) can be used on the same system to answer different but intertwined questions. Mention some research projects that used multiple structural biology projects, and what biological insight each technique provided.
	\item Are there any themes/topics/breakthroughs that you thought should have been included in Nogales overview of cryoEM? 
	\item An electrons phase changes when it passes through the sample. What is the physical cause of these phase modulations? What would properties of the sample would make the phase modulation be higher or lower?
	\item Eq. 1.6 in Glaeser's chapter backs up an approximation of the image wave function that preserved linearity. What exactly is $\epsilon$ and why is it small? Look at Eqs. 1.2 and 1.3. What physical assumptions does this underly. 
	\item For the values in equation 1.3 and 1.4, what can we control experimentally and what is just a physical constant (intrinsic material property of atoms, etc).
%	\item Eq. 1.4 is circularly symmetric. The CTF is often plotted in 1D
	\item Look up some reference(s) from the chapter in an area that interests you. What did you learn. If you were writing the chapter, would you have used this reference differently?

	\item Section 2.4: What weird things have you seen in micrographs, and what do you think is causing them? How could you do some measurements on the microscope to track down what is physically happening?
	\item Section 2.5: What causes the different behaviour at the support water interface (SWI) versus the air water interface (AWI)? Why do proteins not unfold as much at the SWI versus the AWI?
	\item Section 2.5: In Fig 2.10 the edge of the hole is a few lengths the size of the specimen. Is this to scale? How thick is the holey pattern typically?
	\item Section 2.5: Since optimization of sample preparation and vitrification conditions is sample dependent, it's hard to develop heuristic "rules-of-thumb". However, perhaps overall strategies can be generalized? What did you try, and in what order? How long did you spend optimizing certain aspects, and what results helped you to move forward?

\end{itemize}
\textendash {Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item In what sense was the CTF applied to the image of Einstein in Fig 4.6B?
	\item How does w in Eq 4.2 affect the 1D plot of the CTF?
	\item Plug the Scherzer defocus $(\Delta Z = - \sqrt{C_s\lambda})$ into the wave aberration of the CTF in Eq 4.3 
	$(\gamma = 2\pi [ \frac{C_s}{4}\lambda^3 s^4 - \frac{\Delta Z}{2}\lambda s^2 ])$. Can you rework things to make $\gamma = 2 \pi [x^2 + x]$? If so, what is $x$? Is the Scherzer defocus under or over focused?
	\item 4.3.1: The authors mention {\it "The sinusoidal modulations, sometimes referred to as Thon rings, form a characteristic pattern of rings or ellipses observed in computer-generated power spectra. They can be used to determine the defocus and astigmatism to within about 100 $\AA$ [...]. Once a reconstruction has been determined, the defocus parameters can be further refined and other, less significant errors can be measured and corrected (section 4.8). A full correction is therefore an iterative process that starts with an initial estimation of defocus and astigmatism from the electron micrographs themselves, without reference to a 3D reconstruction.}

In your experience with data processing, how much are par particle defoci adjusted vs whole micrograph defocus? How much variability in defocus is there in a micrograph? What else could cause an estimate of defocus to be different vs the physical height of the specimen? How precise and reproducible are CTF estimation algorithms?

	\item 4.3.1: Have you noticed CTF estimation failing? In what cases? Have you been able to fix things by changing default parameters?
	\item 4.3.1: McMullan et al (2015) estimated that "water molecules, each with a molecular mass of 18 Da, move an RMS distance of $ \sim 1 \AA$ for each $e^-/\AA^2$" What would happen if water molecules moved more or less?

		\end{itemize}
	\item 4.3.2: Consider Eqs. 4.7-4.9. What happens at the spatial frequencies where the CTF is zero? How does the image behave at spatial frequencies very close to $(s_x,s_y)$, where the CTF is non zero? How does this change when the SNR is more or less? Useful link: \url{http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/~shaikh/lab/ctf.htm}.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Consider the behaviour at one point  $(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)$
			\item Assume there are four images. Thus $M=4$, and our measurements at the point we are interested in are: $X_1(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime), X_2(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime), X_3(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime), X_4(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)$, where each $X_i = CTF_i \cdot F_i + N_i$
			\item Assume that the CTFs are: $ CTF_1(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=0.1, CTF_2(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=0.2, CTF_3(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=-0.1, CTF_4(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=-0.2 $
			\item Assume that the (random) noise at each image at the $(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)$ is: $N_1(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=1, N_2(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=1, N_3(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=-1, N_4(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=1 $ 
			\item Assume the signal is the same (because the images are aligned): $F_1(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)= F_2(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=F_3(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=F_4(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=1 $ 
			\item Work out the numerator in Eq. 4.9 by multiplying the CTF by the measurement
			\item Work out the denomenator in Eq. 4.9 by multiplying the CTF by the measurement
			\item Using Eq. 4.7 work out $|F(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)|$, assuming $SNR(s_x^\prime,s_y^\prime)=1$.
			\item Repeat this calculation, but doubling the values of the CTFs: $0.2, 0.4, -0.2, -0.4$. What happens to our estimate of F as the magnitude of the CTFs are larger?
			\item Repeat this calculation, with CTFs all equal to $1$. As M gets larger, what will happen to $\sum_i CTF_i^2$ vs $1/SNR$?
		\end{enumerate}
	\item 4.3.2 Consider Eq. 4.10 $D_W =D_P +2\frac{\lambda}{d}\Delta Z.$ The text works out a calculation: $D_W = 200 \AA + 2 \frac{0.0224 \AA}{2 \AA}10000 \AA = 200 \AA + 224 \AA \sim 400 \AA$. Calculate the limiting resolution d for box sizes and specimen diameters you are working with. Do you think box size may be a limiting factor among practitioners? (Note: reference wavelengths of fast electrons for convenience: 0.0388 $\AA$ 100 keV, 0.0274 $\AA$ at 200 keV, and 0.0224 $\AA$ at 300 keV).

	\item 4.4.1.2: why does "retrieving all the information needed to fill the 3D Fourier transform requires more views for a larger particle"?
	\item 4.4.1.2: How exactly do the effects of better alignment estimation and more views "cancel each other out"? See Eq. A 11 in Hederson, 1995. %TODO work through appendix
	\item 4.4.1.3: How many particles of apoferritin are needed to reach $3 \ \AA$? What's the record for the least amount of particles? How does this compare to theoretical estimates?
	\item 4.4.1.3: Why are low molecular weight specimens difficult? What parameters should be tweaked inside of algorithms to make things work for them, and why?
	\item 4.4.1.4: Henderson-Rosenthal plots are $\log$[particle number] vs $1/d^2$, while ResLog plots are vs $1/d$. Do they address the same question? Why the $1/d^2$ vs $1/d$?
	\item 4.4.2.1: What information about the particle alignments (e.g. from 2D classification) is used in 3D reconstruction (in various software packages)? Note that this may not be widely known, require looking at the original publications, and reading the current source code, if available.

\end{itemize}
\textendash {Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 4.7.1: Spend some time studying Figure 4.25. Why does the curve attenuate with a B-factor vs ideal? What is happening in the Fourier transform of the map, when the noise floor is reached (at $\sim 3.0,2.1 \AA$ in this figure)? Why is the noise floor constant? Does the attenuation from the B-factor necessarily imply a loss of signal? Why or why not?
	\item 4.7.4: What are some reasons that the intensity of the radial averaged amplitude spectrum would be lower at high resolution, compared with an ideal case. What exactly would the ideal case represent? For a particular specimen under consideration, how do we compute the ideal radial averaged amplitude spectrum?
	\item 4.7.5: Sketch the radial amplitude profiles (cf. Fig 4.25) corresponding to the different trends in Fig 4.27.
	\item 4.7.5: If there are non-linearities in a ResLog ($\AA^{-2} vs \log N$ plot, what might be the cause?
	\item 4.7.6: What happens in "over sharpening", and how can it be prevented?
	\item 4.7.7: Look up one of the references in the paragraph that starts with "Several algorithms have been proposed to overcome these limitations". After studying this chapter, see if you can follow the logic of the algorithm.
	\item 4.7.7: Discuss why the B-factor as estimated from the amplitude spectrum vs a ResLog plot would be different.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Tim Grant and Peter Rosenthal (2021). 5.3 Recognizing the effect of bias and over-fitting
\end{enumerate}
\textendash {Questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 5.3.1: what is reference bias (or model bias)? Have you encountered it in your own data? If so, what happened?
	\item 5.3.1: what is over-fitting (or over-refinement)? Have you encountered it in your own data? If so, what happened?
	\item 5.3.1: Three contributing factors to map bias are mentioned. Spell out how exactly how these factors might influence map bias in detail. What happens to the data as it flows through cryoEM data processing algorithm? "This map bias problem can potentially affect several important steps during image analysis. Its significance for any particular structure determination problem depends on the {\bf [1] size of the particle}, which is the major determinant of signal in the image, but is also influenced by {\bf [2] heterogeneity and flexibility} and also {\bf [3] sample preparation and imaging conditions} that reduce signal and alignment accuracy" (p. 5.12).
	\item 5.3.2.1: Consider the following statement "It is also essential that the image averages obtained in the subsequent 2D and 3D classification and averaging steps reveal information beyond the resolution limit used to filter the selection template. [...] Absence of high-resolution features in image averages may suggest that the template is only finding matches in the noise up to the limit of the data included in the alignment and the outcome is simply the result of model bias." Is there something you can look for in the existing software packages you use to ensure this is the case? 
	\item 5.3.2.2: Consider Figure 5.6. What non-protein like features have you observed in 2D classes?
	\item 5.3.2.3: If you have ever performed a til-pair analysis, what was your experience like? How long did it take, what conclusions did you draw, and how confident were you in them?
	\item 5.3.3.1: Consider Figure 5.8. What is the difference between the curve with red dots and the curve with blue dots? Why does the blue dot curve drop to zero at $10  \AA$ resolution in panel B but not panel A?
	\item 5.3.4: Consider Figure 5.9. For your specimen, could you see if over-fitting was happening by looking at slices of the density? 
	\item 5.3.4: Consider the following statement: "Because the FSC is a global resolution indicator, its use as a global filter during refinement treats all parts of a map in the same way. It may prevent over-fitting in the strongest, best resolved parts of the map which define the resolution limit of map features used in refinement. However, filtering to the global resolution limit may leave excessive noise in the poorly resolved regions of a map. Iterative refinement may result in the local build-up of spurious features in these weak regions that can still lead to incorrect biological interpretation and also contributes to poorer alignment parameters in each iteration." How do the methods mentioned to overcome this limitation do so?
